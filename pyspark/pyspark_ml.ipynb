Conclusions\n\nSpark is a framework developed specially for big data processing.<br>\nIts default HDFS partition size is 64MB, which means for larger data, Spark process with multiple processors. This way, the processing time does not scalate with the data size.\n\nThe pyspark.ml is the Machine Learning library, with Python interface, developed to work properly with all the advantages of the Spark framework.\n\nAnalyzing both models evaluation, we can see that, although Random Forest achieved a slightly lower ROC AUC Score, its Confusion Matrix metrics were much better than Logistic Regression.\n\n|Metric|Logistic Regression|Random Forest|\n|--|--|--|\n|ROC AUC|1.0000|0.9998|\n|Accuracy|0.8614|0.9917|\n|Precision|1.0000|0.9934|\n|Recall|0.3913|0.9697|\n|F1-Score|0.5625|0.9814|\n\nThe most significant difference is the high Recall and F1-Score for Random Forest, meaning that the Ensemble Model is capable of achieving better predictions of true class (delay). Other diffence is that Logistic Regression is a linear model, while Decision Tree Classifiers are capable of modeling non-linearities from the data.\n\nThe unbalanced distribution of the data affects both classification models. However since Random Forest is an ensemble model, composed of multiple different predictors, it was capable of compensate the unbalance. This unbalance was also responsible for Logistic Regression's high accuracy and precision.\n\nFor the entire data of 1.4 million rows, the Logistic Regression cross-validation took around 8 min to run, while the Random Forest took around 22 min."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"1e301e2d-c31e-4c6a-8a84-4b68ff394594","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"b2e07084-4f0d-45de-84d3-6cd0b7d29bab","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0}],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"notebookName":"pyspark_ml","dashboards":[],"notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":2,"mostRecentlyExecutedCommandWithImplicitDF":{"commandId":-1,"dataframes":["_sqldf"]}},"language":"python","widgets":{},"notebookOrigID":68202399794172}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
